## Summary

This program uploads a bunch of video files to YouTube. You fill out a
CSV file with video filenames, titles, and descriptions, and the
program uploads each video to YouTube with that title and description.

I wrote this to upload several hundred 1-hour-long videos of professors' research seminars at my university.

This program just combines Google's YouTube API tutorial and sample
code for the YouTube Data API on GitHub:

- <https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video>
- <https://github.com/youtube/api-samples>

However, it avoids some traps. For example, the (free) YouTube Data
API limits how many "queries" you can make per day (I got ~100 1-hour
videos uploaded per day), so this program automatically re-tries the
upload every half hour waiting for the quota to reset.

## Background

- Google offers a lot of APIs:
  - <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library>
- The API of interest is the YouTube Data API:
  - <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview>
- These APIs are intended for app developers to write apps that users use to interact with their Google Accounts. Consequently, the system that Google uses to manage credentials is complicated. 
- To use the YouTube API, you need to have a Google account, then make a Project in the Developer Console, then get credentials (a Client ID and Client Secret).
- Credential types: OAuth 2.0 credentials vs API keys
  - Using an API key: To use this API you need an API key. An API key identifies your project to check quotas and access. Go to the Credentials page to get an API key. Youâ€™ll need a key for each platform, such as Web, Android, and iOS. 
  - Accessing user data with OAuth 2.0: You can access user data with this API. On the Credentials page, create an OAuth 2.0 client ID. A client ID requests user consent so that your app can access user data. Include that client ID when making your API call to Google.
  - Because we're trying to access private user data (private videos), we need OAuth 2.0 credentials.
  - Source: <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview>

## Installation

Following the YouTube Data API tutorial "Upload a Video" (<https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video>),

- Use Python 2.5 or higher
- Install Google APIs client library for Python:
  - `$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`
  - <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation>

- Create a Google Account if you don't have one (or make a temporary one)
  - TIP: If using a different Google account than your normal one, do all this in "private" or "incognito" browser windows to avoid getting logged-out of your normal gmail etc.
  - If your videos are longer than 15 minutes, you'll need to "verify" your Google account before uploading them:
    - <https://www.youtube.com/verify>

- Create a new Google APIs project:
  - <https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials>
  - <https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application>
  - This results in you getting a 'client id' and 'client secret', which you should put in a file `client_secrets.json` like this:

      {
        "web": {
          "client_id": "[[INSERT CLIENT ID HERE]]",
          "client_secret": "[[INSERT CLIENT SECRET HERE]]",
          "redirect_uris": [],
          "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
          "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
        }
      }
                    

## Test: Upload one video

In `upload_video.py`, edit this line to include the absolute path to `client_secrets.json`:

     CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE = "/Users/justin/Projects/YouTube-batch-upload/api-samples/python/client_secrets.json"

(This seems to avoid a weird error about not being able to find the json file.)

Then edit and run `upload-to-youtube-api-test.py`, which just does this:

    python upload_video.py --file="/tmp/test_video_file.flv"   # <----- your video file here
                           --title="Summer vacation in California"
                           --description="Had fun surfing in Santa Cruz"
                           --keywords="surfing,Santa Cruz"
                           --category="22"
                           --privacyStatus="private"


**Note**: Use absolute paths for the video.


## Upload multiple videos

Like `upload_video.py`, edit `upload_video-many.py` so the CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE has an absolute path.

The file `upload_video-many.py` is mostly the same as `upload_video.py`, except that it reads the CSV file `CCDC Seminars - Seminars (1).csv`, which has columns

     cols = [
         'Talk Video',
         'Talk Title',
         'Speaker Name',
         'Speaker Organization',
         'Date start',
         'Speaker Bio',
         'Talk Abstract',
         'Seminar Series',
         'Video URL'
         ]

Each line represents a video that may or may not be uploaded. 

- The program `seminar-csv-parse.py` is a test program that reads through the CSV file and makes a Title and Description for each line. I pasted its code into `upload_video-many.py` afterward.
- If 'Video URL' is present, the line is skipped (presumably the video has been already uploaded during a previous run).
  - See the code for other conditions that skip the line, you'll probably want to modify it for your own application.
- The 'Talk Video' field is the name of the video. Its absolute path is hard-coded in the code, you'll need to change this line:
  - `absfile = os.path.join('/media/justin/ccdc_vid_backup/videos_seminars/',file)`



## Errors


### Error: redirect_uri_mismatch

"The redirect URI in the request, http://localhost:8080/, does not match the ones authorized for the OAuth client. Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/blahblahblah to update the authorized redirect URIs."

- Went to <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#setredirecturi>.
- Added "http://localhost:8080/" to 'redirect url' in some google api page.
- I see `client_secrets.json` has the line `"redirect_uris": []`, maybe I should've filled it in?


### Error: "UserWarning: Cannot access oauth2.json: No such file or directory"

From <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40546319/drive-api-error-python-doesnt-found-json-quickstart-file>:

'''
I went into the same issue with google calendar api. To solve the problem simply use the absolute file path to your CLIENT_SECRET_FILE like:

CLIENT_SECRET_FILE = r'C:\Users\xxx\client_secret.json'
The file drive-python-quickstart.json will be created after authentication automatically.
'''

Edited upload_video.py : Used absolute path to CLIENT_SECRET. Worked.


### Error: Cannot access ./upload_video-many.py-oauth2.json: No such file or directory

- Since `upload_video.py` worked, I just copied the `oauth2.json` file from `upload_video.py`:

      $ cp -a upload_video.py-oauth2.json upload_video-many.py-oauth2.json


### Error: On the video's youtube page: "Upload failed: Video too long"

<https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/71673?visit_id=1-636406986494486922-4140592693&hl=en&rd=1>

We should've 'verified' our  account first. (Google texts or calls a phone #. Can use 1 phone # twice per year for this.)

Go to <https://www.youtube.com/verify> to verify.


### Error "uploadLimitExceeded: The user has exceeded the number of videos they may upload."

This was after uploading 94 videos. Apparently there's some limit we've exceeded?

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42998086/youtube-video-uploads-rejected-before-api-quota-limit-reached
- https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/quotas?project=upload-ccdc-videos   (your project name here)
- https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?project=upload-ccdc-videos

Hm, can't understand their units of "quota": Says I've only used 40k of 1M queries today, but I'm still getting this error.. Why??

Added a while loop to catch errors and retry every 30 mins. At 4pm
PDT, they resumed for a while: uploaded another 100 vids, then got the
error again. Fine.
