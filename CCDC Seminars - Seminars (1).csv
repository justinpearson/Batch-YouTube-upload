We consider a thermoelastic rod that may come into contact with a rigid obstacle. The model captures many issues common to a number of practical problems such as brake heating where thermoelastic effects are important. These problems are such that virtually all well known methods for treating distributed problems cannot be applied since the non-linear, non-local nature of the model means that most assumptions required by these methods simply do not hold."299,2/3/10 11:00,2/3/10 12:00,2010a Winter,4164 HFH,CCDC Seminar,"Cyber-Physical Systems: A Few Results, a New Direction and an Application",20100203-BrunoSinopoli.m4v,https://youtu.be/Xop8cFudNHA,Bruno Sinopoli,Professor,,BrunoSinopoli.jpg,http://128.111.60.77/ccdc-pics/BrunoSinopoli.jpg,Carnegie Mellon University,,"Bruno Sinopoli received the Dr. Eng. degree from the University of Padova in 1998 and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, in 2003 and 2005 respectively, along with the Management of Technology Certificate from the Haas Business School.

We refer to systems that bridge the cyber-world of computing and communications with the physical one as cyber-physical systems (CPS). The convergence of such disciplines raises significant engineering challenges because of the scale, the need to bridge physical and software domains, and the need to operate efficiently, securely and reliably. We propose to develop innovative methods and tools for three critical sub-problems: 1) Efficient Resource Allocation, i.e. the capability to efficiently parse the potentially enormous amount of data to distill the information relevant to failure/attack detection, estimation, control, and decision-making; 2-) Security, i.e. the capability to detect malicious attacks, to guarantee continuity of operations with gracefully decreased functionalities, and to ultimately thwart attacks by reconfiguring and restoring full functionality; 3-) Robustness/ Reconfigurability, i.e. the capability to handle change. In this talk we will discuss novel approaches for sensor scheduling to address energy efficiency and performance guarantees with respect to estimation and detection applications. Motivated by an example we will then explore the relationship between security and control systems. Finally we will describe our approach to decreasing energy consumption in data centers."300,2/5/10 15:00,2/5/10 16:00,2010a Winter,1171 Chem,CCDC Seminar,Origins of the Compressive Nonlinearity of Hearing,20100205-RobertSzalai.m4v,,Robert Szalai,Professor,,RobertSzalai.jpg,http://128.111.60.77/ccdc-pics/RobertSzalai.jpg,University of Bristol,,"Robert Szalai is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bristol Centre for Applied Nonlinear Mathematics at the University of Bristol since 2006.

He has held a Fulbright Fellowship at the MIT in 2004 â€“ 2005 and a visiting fellowship at the University of Bristol in 2004. His research interests are in the mechanics of mammalian hearing, machine-tool vibrations, piecewise-smooth systems, delay equations and invariant manifolds.","Mammalian hearing has a complex physiology that is still not completely understood. One of its most studied aspects is the cochlear amplification. In vivo experiments suggest that the cochlear amplifier is compressively nonlinear, has sharp tuning and prone to otoacoustic emissions. It is hypothesized in the literature that all of these features can be modeled by the so-called Hopf oscillator. However, the Hopf normal form is a local model not designed to be forced by a large variation of amplitudes and it has to be tuned near instability whose mechanism remains to be uncovered. In this talk we present alternative models that reproduce the experimental observations equally well as the Hopf oscillator. In fact, one can build a phenomenological model without the need to be tuned near a bifurcation. We also introduce two physiological models, one of them is an outer hair cell model proposed by Ã“ MaoilÃ©idigh and JÃ_licher that accounts for features such as hair bundle movement, adaptation and charge movement inside the cell. We find that it is not necessary to tune this model into the region where Hopf bifurcations occur to reproduce the characteristic nonlinearity. Our final model uses the essence of the outer hair cell model and adds features like mechanical feedback that yield the desired sharp tuning and nonlinear compression. (Joint work with D.

For example, the MIT entry to the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, which finished the competition in 4th place, used an RRT-like planning and control algorithm that performed flawlessly throughout the 60-mile race. While very effective, both in theory and in practice, at finding feasible paths for a dynamical systems through a complicated environment, RRTs have a number of limitations, among which (i) no characterization of the â€œqualityâ€ù of the solution provided, and (ii) no ability to deal with tasks other than reaching a point while avoiding obstacles. The subject of the talk will be recent advances in the above directions. First, a negative result is given: it is proven that the cost of the best path in a RRT converges almost surely to a sub-optimal value, as the number of samples n increases. Based on the insight gained through the proof of this result, a new algorithm, called RRT* is proposed, which provably yields paths whose cost converges almost surely to the optimum. The computational overhead of RRT* is shown to be O (log n) with respect to the standard algorithm. Finally, we consider the problem of computing plans that satisfy a class of temporal logic specifications, describing, e.g., rules of the road or mission objectives. The proposed algorithms, generalizing sampling-based methods, incrementally build finite transition systems representing a discrete subset of dynamically feasible trajectories. At each iteration, local mu-calculus model-checking methods are used to establish whether the current transition system satisfies the specifications. Efficient sampling strategies are presented, ensuring the probabilistic completeness of the algorithms."
